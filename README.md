## Train-Schedule

Used JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Moment.js, and Firebase to update a train schedule and train times.

Start out with a train to the North Pole once a year. If the user wants other transportation options, they can add more train names, destinations, desired start times, and frequency of trains.
